# ParseSignalPeptides
ParseSignalPeptides.py was developed in order to extract a query list of peptides from a Protein database (Uniprot) and parse the results obtained, looking for a signal peptide. This program was specially tailored to use this protein database with its .xml output format and relies solely in the information provided by it. The program provides the following information for each line entry of a Uniprot accession code: signal peptide range, Uniprot “Subcellular location” annotation, the protein complete sequence and if the motif “XXEL” was found in the end of the protein sequence and the found motif sequence.
